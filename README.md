# What and where are the world's oldest businesses

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when they were founded, and industries they belong to.

Like many business problems, the data I explored contained several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I first used joining techniques to merge our data. From there, used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

The analysis was carried out using python, and libraries used include Pandas, and Numpy for several analysis and computations.

#### Analysis Conducted Inludes Finding:
- The Oldest Business in the World
- The Oldest Business in each continent
- The Oldest Industries
- The Oldest Industries in each Continent

#### Steps Taken:
- The Steps and descriptions can be found within the jupyter file

#### Findings:
- We were able to get oldest industries for each continent available from our dataset
- Using our findings, anyone looking to venture into a business in any of these continents and interested in the longetivity of their business can take a sample from our results to determine a suitable industry to start with.
- It was also interesting to learn about the oldest industries in the world
- Banking and Finance is an excellent industry to be in if longevity is the goal
